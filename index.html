<h6>STRENGTHS :</h6>
                    <p>That would be my ability to write efficient code and deliver projects on time, even if the deadlines are near.</p>
                    <p>By habit, I check all my codes for bugs, ensuring that the work I submit can be implemented without delay.</p>
                    <h6>WEAKNESSES :</h6>
<p> I like to make sure that my work is perfect, so I tend to perhaps spend a little too much time checking it. However, I've come to a good balance by setting up a system to ensure everything is done the first time correctly. </p>
                    <p>
                    I used to wait until the last minute to set appointments for the coming week, but I realized that scheduling in advance makes much more sense. </p>
                    <p>Sometimes, I spend more time than necessary on a task or take on task personally that could easily be delegated to someone else. Although I've never missed a deadline, it is still an effort for me to know when to move on to the next task, and to be confident when assigning others work.</p>

                    <p> Pressure is essential to me. When there are a lot of assignments to work on in order to meet the deadlines, this is "good pressure" for me. That helps me to stay motivated and do well . </p>
                    
                    <p>Although multiple assignments can be quite stressful at times, however, I'm good at balancing things. Once upon a time in my college, I had my semester exams aligned with my final year project. But, I broke down my tasks in a scheduled manner and did well in both of them . Thus , I avoided unwanted stress.</p>

I like to draw out the unique skill set of my team members. In the past, I worked in a group where two of my team members seemed to be introverts. I motivated them to speak up and it helped. They got involved in the project and gave valuable inputs. It helped a lot in the timely project completion."</p>
